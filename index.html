    <h3>Q.1
        <pre>
    " function counter(){
    var counter = 0;
    
    function IncreaseCounter() {
    return counter += 1;
    };

    alert(counter());
    alert(counter());
    alert(counter());
    alert(counter());"

    ANS:1, 2, 3, 4

    Explanation:This programme defines the counter() function, which returns the IncreaseCounter() function. The counter() method
    provides a closure that enables the IncreaseCounter() function to read and alter the counter variable while initialising
    a counter variable to zero.
    Every time it is called, the IncreaseCounter() method adds one to the counter variable's current value and returns it.

            <pre>
            "let count = 0;
            (function () {
            if (count === 0) {
            let count = 1;
            console.log(count); // What is logged?
            }
            console.log(count); // What is logged?
            })();"

            ANS: 1, 0
            Explanation: I have created one variable with count 0.
            The if statement determines whether the outer count variable's value equals zero. If it is, the let keyword, which
            defines a new block-scoped variable, is used to declare a new variable inside the block with the same name, count. It is
            decided to give this new count variable a value of 1. The new count variable's value, 1, is printed by the console.log()
            command inside the if block.
            The value of the outer count variable is output after the if block, and it is still set to 0, as the inner count
            variable within the if block only lives within that block and has no effect on the outer count variable.
            
            Following the IIFE's implementation, the code outputs 1 and 0 to the console.

           "for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++)
            { 
            setTimeout(function log() 
            { 
                console.log(i); // What is logged?
             }, 1000); }"

          
            ANS: 3, 3, 3

            Explanation:
            When this code is run, a loop is set up that iterates three times, each time increasing the value of the
            variable i by
            one. With a delay of 1000 milliseconds and the function log() as its parameter, the setTimeout() function is
            called
            inside the loop.
            All three function calls are executed after the loop has ended and i has been increased to a final value of
            3, as each
            setTimeout() call is postponed by 1000 milliseconds. As a result, each time the log() method is used, the
            value of i,
            which is always 3, is logged.

            As a result, when this code is run, the number 3 is logged to the console three times, each time with a
            delay of 1000
            milliseconds.

        <h3>Q.4 Write a code to calculate area of a rectangle using inner function. In this case outer function should
            accept parameter
            length and inner function should accept parameter breadth.
            <pre>
            ANS:
            function OuterFunction(L) {
            function InerFunction(B) {
            console.log(`Area: ${L * B}`)
            }
            InerFunction(10);
            }
            OuterFunction(20);

            Output: 200

            Explanation:
            The function OuterFunction, which has the parameter L, is defined in this code. There is a function called InnerFunction
            defined inside the OuterFunction that only accepts the parameter B. The InnerFunction uses the formula L * B to get the
            area of a rectangle, where L is the rectangle's length and B is its width.
            The InnerFunction is called from the OuterFunction with the parameter value of 10. L can be accessed by both the
            InnerFunction and the B parameter because it is already declared in the OuterFunction's scope. In this instance, L is 20
            and B is 10, so the InnerFunction determines the area of a rectangle with these dimensions: 200.

        <h3>Q.5/Take a variable in outer function and create an inner function to increase the counter every time it is

      const incrementCounter = outerFunction() ;
      incrementCounter(); // Output: Counter value: 1
      incrementCounter(); // Output: Counter value: 2
      incrementCounter(); // Output: Counter value: 3

    ANS: 1 2 3 4 

    Explanation:
    This code creates the outerFunctionÂ function, which returns the innerFunction function.
    
    The innerFunction function, which is defined by the outerFunction function, increments the counter local variable by 1
    each time it is called and logs the new value of counter to the console. The outerFunction function initialises the
    counter local variable to zero.
    
    Following the function call, the innerFunction function is returned by the outerFunction function.

    Also, a new variable called incrementCounter is created and given the return value of the outerFunction() call in the
    code. As a result, incrementCounter is currently referring to the innerFunction function, which has a separate counter
    variable and is defined inside outerFunction.
    
    The code then uses incrementCounter() four times, executing the innerFunction function each time and raising the counter
    variable's value by 1. As a result, the output is 1, 2, 3, and 4 each time the value of counter is recorded to the
    console.

        <h3>Q.6/

        ANS:12

        Explanation:
        With this code, a is created and its value is set to 12.
        
        After that, an anonymous function is defined and called immediately by including it in parentheses and adding ().
        
        The value of the variable an is given inside the anonymous function. The user is informed of the value of the global
        variable a, which is 12 when the anonymous function is called.

                alert(a);
                };
                })();
                x();"

                ANS:12

                Explanation:
                The two variables a and x are created by.
                
                The value of x is set to the result of using an anonymous function, and the variable an is set to 10.
                
                An anonymous function creates a new variable called a, sets it to the value 12, and then returns a function that logs
                the value of a to the console.
                
                The variable x has the returning function allocated to it. When x() is called, the function is run and the variable a's
                value, 12, is logged to the console.
                
                The function returned by the anonymous function has access to the variable a declared within the anonymous function's
                scope rather than the global variable a, which is why 12 is logged instead of 10 in the output.

                outerVar = a
                innerVar = b
                globalVar = xyz

                Explanation:
                var globalVar = "xyz";: Declares and initialises a global variable called globalVar with the value "xyz."
                
                (func outerFunc(outerArg)...)(123);: This is an immediately-invoked function expression (IIFE) with the parameter 123
                that takes an argument outerArg and is called immediately. Within this function:
                
                a. var outerVar = 'a';: Declares and sets the value 'a' to a local variable outerVar.
                
                (function innerFunc(innerArg)...)(456);: Another IIFE defined within the outerFunc. It accepts an argument innerArg and
                is invoked immediately with the argument 456. Within this internal function:
                
                i. var innerVar = 'b';: Declares and sets the value 'b' to a local variable innerVar.
                
                ii. console.log(...);: This line prints to the console the following values:
                - `"outerArg = " + outerArg`: Displays the value of the `outerArg` parameter, which is `123`.
                - `"innerArg = " + innerArg`: Displays the value of the `innerArg` parameter, which is `456`.
                - `"outerVar = " + outerVar`: Displays the value of the `outerVar` variable, which is `'a'`.
                - `"innerVar = " + innerVar`: Displays the value of the `innerVar` variable, which is `'b'`.
                - `"globalVar = " + globalVar`: Displays the value of the `globalVar` variable, which is `'xyz'`.

                Therefore, the output of the code will be:
                outerArg = 123
                innerArg = 456
                outerVar = a
                innerVar = b
                globalVar = xyz
